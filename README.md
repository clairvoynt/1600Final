<H1> A Quick Tutorial on File Formats </H1>

By Dylan Curtiss

The following is a brief summary of different file types and fun facts about them. This guide is useful for both introductory computer users and dedicated computer veterans who are looking for specific information on less common file types.

Audio Files
MP3- .mp3
This file type is often utilized for storing music because they take up little hard drive space.
WAV- .wav
This file type was widely popularized because of its release with Windows 95 but were later nullified by 
MP3 files.
Compressed Files
ZIP- .zip
This is a lossless-compression binary file developed by Phillip Katz. It can help make file size significantly 
smaller.
RAR- .rar
These are the files you get by using WinRAR to compress a file and was developed in 1993 by Russian 
software engineer Eugene Roshal. RAR stands for Roshal Archive.
Database and Database File Extensions
Comma separated value file- .csv
Most CSV files are plain-text files and tables of values meant to be viewed through spreadsheet 
programs.
Log file- .log
Some of the earliest log files were introduced in Microsoft Windows 2000 and are still used today.
Executable File Extensions
Executable file- .exe
This type of file is used to run functions on a computer, hence the word execute.
Python file- .py
This format is used to the coding software Python, and I use it on mostly all of my IT 1040 homework.
Image File Formats
GIF- .gif
There is an ongoing controversy about whether it is pronounced gif or jif, with the latter crowd being 
both extremely steadfast and wrong in their opinion.
Portable Network Graphics- .png
This image format can either be pronounced P-N-G or ping, and features lossless compression.
Presentation File Formats
PowerPoint presentation- .ppt
.ppt files open to the editing software in PowerPoint, but .pps files open to the presentation.
Keynote presentation- .key
Programming File Formats
Java Source code file- .java
Minecraft is run on Java!
Visual Basic file- .vb
There are six versions of the coding language Visual Basic.
System File Formats
Dynamic-link library- .dll
This is my least favorite file type because I always have the wrong software to open it. It is essentially 
the backbone for developers.
MSI- .msi
This file format is for prepackaged Windows software installations.
Video File Formats
MPEG4 video file- .mp4
This is the standard video file. Here is Garfield: The Movie (2004). 
Audio Video Interleave- .avi
This file type is used under Microsoft Windows video files and cannot exceed 2 GB.
Word Processer and Text File Formats
Microsoft Word file- .doc and .docx
I am currently writing this project on a .docx file
Plain text file- .txt
This is the type of file used when you open notepad or any other software to scribble something down.
